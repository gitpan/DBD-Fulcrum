DBD::Fulcrum  --  a Fulcrum SearchServer interface for Perl 5

   You may distribute under the terms of either the GNU General Public
   License or the Artistic License, as specified in the Perl README file.

   PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE README FILE CAREFULLY !


*BEFORE* BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5 (at least 5.003, this version developed on 5.004)
    It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

    Build, test and install the DBI module (at least DBI 0.71 - this version developed with 0.85).
    Tested and working with DBI 0.85, but the data_sources method is not implemented (yet).
    It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

    Remember to *read* the DBI README file!

    Install enough Fulcrum SearchServer software to enable DBD::Fulcrum to build.
    That includes the C Software Development Kit.
    Contact Fulcrum (http://www.fulcrum.com) for any information about their products.


BUILDING:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make

If it's builds without error you can then run the tests. For the
main test to work it must be able to connect to a Fulcrum SearchServer table.
To avoid unforseeable problems with a real, production table, following these simple
instructions to build your own brand-new use-it-once table.

Copy the following files from Fulcrum SearchServer installation directories (usually $ENV{'FULCRUM_HOME'}/fultext)
to your new directory (you can use fultest under the DBD-Fulcrum dist,
that's exactly what it's there for).
	fultext.ftc
	fultext.eft
	ftpdf.ini (only 3.5)
	*mess files 

Set FULCRUM_HOME to your Fulcrum SearchServer installation directory (e.g. /usr/fulcrum).
Set FULCREATE, FULSEARCH and FULTEMP to the brand-new directory (thus avoiding the risk
of leaving files around at the end of the process).
Create the table test using the script test.fte:
   	execsql -0 test.fte

If execsql is not found, try $FULCRUM_HOME/bin/execsql.

Starting with version 0.11, this distribution provides an handy build-dir.sh script. Fed with
$FULCRUM_HOME and the test directory name as parameters on command line, it will create the directory,
initialize it with Fulcrum files, and build the test table. 
	./build-dir.sh $FULCRUM_HOME fultest
is as good an example as any (and you'll have to set FULCRUM_HOME before, too, so it might be considered
actually healthy).
Output of the script goes to build-dir.log for later perusal.


	make test

	make install (if the tests look okay)

As of this release, building on DEC OSF/1 requires static linking and hand-editing of the Makefile
midway through the build. Sorry, I haven't had enough time to clean things up yet.
Anyway, this should be working and is being used in a number of production systems.

It is frequent to have and invalid or unreasonable FULTEMP variable. Usually you'll get cryptic 
messages about memory not being enough. Be sure FULTEMP is valid and is readable/writable to whom
must execute the program using DBD::Fulcrum.


IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

Do not hand edit the generated Makefile unless you are completely sure
you understand the implications! Always try to make changes via the
Makefile.PL command line and/or editing the Makefile.PL.

You should not need to make any changes. If you do *please* let me
know so that I can try to make it automatic in a later release.

Please post details of any problems (or changes you needed to make) to
dbi-users@fugue.com and CC them to me at Davide.Migliavacca@inferentia.it. But note...

** IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

1. A complete log of a all steps of the build, e.g.:

	perl Makefile.PL           (do a make realclean first)
	make
	make test
	make test TEST_VERBOSE=1   (only if any of the t/* tests fail)

2. Full details of which version of FUlcrum SearchServer, Perl and OS you're using.

3. The output of perl -V

_Always_ have the appropriate amount of fun,
Davide.
